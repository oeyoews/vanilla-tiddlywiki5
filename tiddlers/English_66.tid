"""【主干识别】Nor is management to be blamed.Nor置于句首引起倒装，正常语序为management is not to be blamed.

【其他成分】if regularity and conformity to a standard pattern are as desirable to the scientist as the writing of his papers would appear to reflect状语从句；for discriminating against the "odd balls" among researchers in favor of more conventional thinkers who "work well with the team状语。

【微观解析】if regularity and conformity to a standard pattern are as desirable to the scientist as the writing of his papers would appear to reflect主干为：regularity and conformity are as desirable；to a standard pattern定语修饰regularity and conformity；to the scientist状语； as thewriting of his papers would appear to reflect. As 引导的定语从句修饰 regularity and conformity，as在句中做reflecte 的宾语，如果在科学家的论文中所反应出的对于标准模板的遵守和认同正是其所想得到的话。

【难点揭秘】由于nor 置于句首所引起的倒装和由as 所引导的定语从句造成阅读上的困难。
