"""【主干识别】：That was important

【解析】most important 为形容词置于句首后紧接系动词可以判定为倒装；主干的顺序应该是：that was most important.而they had all maintained with a certain fidelity the technique and composition consistent with those of America’s first popular landscape artist, Thomas Cole, who built a career painting the Catskill Mountain scenery bordering the Hudson River.为主语从句，在翻译的时候先翻冗长的主语从句。

【微观分析】：主语从句的主干：1.they had all maintained with a certain fidelity the technique and composition（注意 with a certain fidelity做状语）

2. consistent with those of America’s first popular landscape artist（做后置定语修饰technique，consistent形容词，与...相一致）

3. Thomas Cole做同位语

4.who built a career painting the Catskill Mountain scenery 定语从句修饰thomas cole其中painting...做career的后置定语

5. bordering the Hudson River后置定语修饰scenery.
