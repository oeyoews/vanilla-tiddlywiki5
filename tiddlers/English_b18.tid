"""【译文赏析】审查者完全有理由相信，知道自己准备做什么、怎么做的科学家不应该因为必须一只眼盯着收银机，另一只眼盯着显微镜而分散了注意力。

【翻译点拨】by短语在句子中是充当状语，翻译为原因，where they are going and how they will get there处理为知道做什么，知道怎么做，这样的表达符合中文的习惯。如果直接翻译为：知道他们要去哪里和怎么去，就是对于字面含义的翻译。属于死译。

同时有同学问了一个比较好的句子我也给大家一起分析了，学有余力的同学可以看看，鼓励大家都问问题：

In a way , our peculiarly American failure to come to terms with Darwin 's theory and what it's become since 1859 is a sign of something broader : our failure to come to terms with science and the teaching of science.

主干分析：

Our failure is a sign of something broader

其他成分：

to come to terms with Darwin 's theory and what it's become since 1859定语修饰failure;

:后的内容解释说明something；

难点分析：句子有一个固定词组：come to terms with 向...妥协，接受

翻译：从某种程度上讲，我们按照特有的美国人的方式拒绝接受达尔文的理论以及其在1859年后的变化，就表明了一些更宽泛的事情：我们未能接受科学和科学的教育。

翻译点拨：Failure不要翻译成名词，而翻译为动词，未能接受=拒绝接受。
